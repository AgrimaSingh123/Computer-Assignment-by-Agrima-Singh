            Rajasthan  is a state in northern India. The state covers an area of 342,239 square kilometres (132,139 sq mi) or 
            10.4 percent of the total geographical area of India. It is the largest Indian state by area and the seventh largest
             by population. Rajasthan is located on the northwestern side of India, where it comprises most of the wide and 
             inhospitable Thar Desert (also known as the "Great Indian Desert") and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces
              of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus river valley. It is bordered by five other
               Indian states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; 
               and Gujarat to the southwest. Its geographical location is 23.3 to 30.12 North latitude and 69.30 to 78.17 East 
               longitude, with the Tropic of Cancer passing through southernmost tip of the state.
